Purpose:
	This is a simple example for A/D conversion with interrupt mode
	Using UART0 with this configuration – 115200bps – 8 data bit – No parity – 1 stop bit – No flow control 
	to display this conversion.

Hardware configuration:
	This example tested on Keil MCB1700 with LPC1768 vers.1
	These jumpers must be configured as following:
		- VDDIO, VDDREGS, VBUS, AD0.2, LED must be closed.

Running mode:
	This example can run on FLASH after burning.
	
Note:
	None
