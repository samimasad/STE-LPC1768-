Purpose:
	This is a simple example for CAN peripheral to test functions that support add/remove AFLUT entry dynamically.
	We use 2 CAN peripheral CAN1 and CAN2 in the same kit to test CAN operation.
	This example supports FullCAN and Group ID Frame Format.
 	First, we send 10 messages, include:
 		- 5 messages (0,2,4,6,8) have ID in AFLUT --> will be received 
 		- 5 messages (1,3,5,7,9) don't have ID in AFLUT --> will be ignored
 	Then, we change AFLUT by load and remove entries in AFLUT and re-send messages
 		- 5 messages (1,3,5,7,9) have ID in ALFUT --> will be received 
 		- 5 messages (0,2,4,6,8) don't have ID in AFLUT --> will be ignored
	Using UART0 with this configuration:
		– 115200bps 
		– 8 data bits
		– No parity 
		– 1 stop bit 
		– No flow control 
	
Hardware configuration:
	This example tested on Keil MCB1700 with LPC1768 ver.1
	- CAN1-Pin2 connects to CAN2-Pin2
	- CAN1-Pin7 connects to CAN1-Pin7	
	
Running mode:
	This example can run on FLASH after burning.
	
Note:
	- FullCAN Object must be read from FullCAN Object Section next to AFLUT
