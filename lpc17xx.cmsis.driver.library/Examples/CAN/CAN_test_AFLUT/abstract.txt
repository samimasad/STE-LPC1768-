Purpose:
	This is a simple example for CAN peripheral to test full Acceptance Filter operation.
	We use 2 CAN peripheral CAN1 and CAN2 in the same kit to test CAN operation.
	This example supports FullCAN and Group ID Frame Format.
 	To test AF mode: we setup a simple AF Lookup Table with 5 sections:
 		- FullCAN Identifier Frame Format Section
	  	- Explicit Standard Frame Format Identifier Section
	  	- Group of Standard Frame Format Identifier Section
	  	- Explicit Extended Frame Format Identifier Section
	  	- Group of Extended Frame Format Identifier Section
 	and initialize 10 messages, include:
 		- 5 messages have ID exit in 5 sections
 		- 5 messages have ID not exit in AF Lookup Table
	to check AF operation
	Using UART0 with this configuration:
		– 115200bps 
		– 8 data bits
		– No parity 
		– 1 stop bit 
		– No flow control 
	
Hardware configuration:
	This example tested on Keil MCB1700 with LPC1768 ver.1
	- CAN1-Pin2 connects to CAN2-Pin2
	- CAN1-Pin7 connects to CAN1-Pin7	
	
Running mode:
	This example can run on FLASH after burning.
	
Note:
	- FullCAN Object must be read from FullCAN Object Section next to AFLUT
