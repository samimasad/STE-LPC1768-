Purpose:
	This is a simple example for CAN peripheral to test Bypass mode
	We use 2 CAN peripheral CAN1 and CAN2 in the same kit to test CAN operation.
	To test Bypass mode: we send infinite messages to CAN2.
	After each transfer, we increase ID message and its data to continue transmit.

	Using UART0 with this configuration:
		– 115200bps 
		– 8 data bits
		– No parity 
		– 1 stop bit 
		– No flow control 
	
Hardware configuration:
	This example tested on Keil MCB1700 with LPC1768 ver.1
	- CAN1-Pin2 connects to CAN2-Pin2
	- CAN1-Pin7 connects to CAN1-Pin7	
	
Running mode:
	This example can run on RAM mode with a debugger or on FLASH after burning.

	- FullCAN Object must be read from FullCAN Object Section next to AFLUT
