Purpose:
	This is a simple example to test CAN transfer data between two board

	Using UART0 with this configuration:
		– 115200bps 
		– 8 data bits
		– No parity 
		– 1 stop bit 
		– No flow control 
	
Hardware configuration:
	This example tested on Keil MCB1700 with LPC1768 ver.1
	- CAN1-Pin2 on the first board connects to CAN1-Pin2 on the second board.
	- CAN1-Pin7 on the first board connects to CAN1-Pin7 on the second board.	
	
Running mode:
	Run the transmit programe on first board on FLASH mode.
	Run the receive programe on second board on RAM mode with debugger.
	
Note:
	- If you want to chose Transmit or Receive programe, check via macro "CAN_TRANSMIT"
