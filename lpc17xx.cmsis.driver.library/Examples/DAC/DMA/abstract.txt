Purpose:
	This is DMA example apply for transfer  memory to DAC peripheral 
	Using UART0 with this configuration – 115200bps – 8 data bit – No parity – 1 stop bit – No flow control 
	to display this transfer.

Hardware configuration:
	This example tested on Keil MCB2300 platform v4.0 with LPC1768
	These jumpers must be configured as following:
		- VBUS must be closed.
		- Jump AOUT must be connected.

Running mode:
	This example can run on RAM mode with a debugger or run on FLASH after burning.
	
Note:
