Purpose:
	A simple program to test GPIO interrupt functionality to drive LCD on MCB1700
	Using UART0 with this configuration – 115200bps – 8 data bit – No parity – 1 stop bit – No flow control
Hardware configuration:
	This example tested on MCB1700 board vers.1
	These jumpers must be configured as following:
	These jumpers must be configured as following:
		- VDDIO, VDDREGS, VBUS must be closed.

Running mode:
	This example can run on RAM mode with a debugger or run on FLASH.
