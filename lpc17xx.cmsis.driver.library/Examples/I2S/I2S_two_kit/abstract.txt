Purpose:
	This is a simple example for I2S: use 2 I2S channels: I2S Transmit & Receive channel in separate board
	to communicate each other.
	I2S configuration:
			- wordwidth: 16 bits
	  		- stereo mode
	  		- master mode for I2S_TX and slave for I2S_RX
	  		- Frequency = 44.1 kHz (x=8,y=51 - automatic setting)	 
	Using UART0 with this configuration:
			– 115200bps 
			– 8 data bit
			– No parity 
			– 1 stop bit 
			– No flow control 
	
Hardware configuration:
	This example tested on Keil MCB1700 with LPC1768 ver.1
	These jumpers must be configured as following:
	- VDDIO, VDDREGS, VBUS must be closed.
	
	- P0.4(J.116) on board 1 connect to P0.7(J.112) on board 2
	- P0.5(J.115) on board 1 connect to P0.8(J.111) on board 2
	- P0.6(J.113) on board 1 connect to p0.9(J.109) on board 2
	Common ground must be connected together between two board.
	
Running mode:
	- Run Transmit program in board 1 on FLASH mode.
	- Run Receive program in board 2 on RAM mode. So you can debug CAN operation via COM0 port.
