Purpose:
	This example will test Motor Control PWM module in LPC17xx.
	Tested function on MCPWM could be: 3-phase AC mode, 3-phase DC mode, capture on Motor Control
	Feed back input pin
	Using UART0 with this configuration – 115200bps – 8 data bit – No parity – 1 stop bit 
	– No flow control to display information.

Hardware configuration:
	This example tested on Keil MCB1700 with LPC1768 ver.1
	These jumpers must be configured as following:
		- VDDIO, VDDREGS, VBUS must be closed.
		- The output signal can be observed by oscilloscope on these pins below:
			+ P1.19 - MC0A
			+ P1.22 - MC0B
			+ P1.25 - MC1A
			+ P1.26 - MC1B
			+ P1.28 - MC2A
			+ P1.29 - MC2B
		- For the capture function, pin MCFB/MCI0 (P1.20) must be connected with pin MC0B
		to capture the pulse-width of signal output of MC0B from the beginning to
		the falling edge.

Running mode:
	This example can run on RAM mode with a debugger or run on FLASH after burning.
	
Note:
	- To test 3-phase DC mode, the symbol DC_MODE_TEST must be set to 1
	- To test 3-phase AC mode, the symbol AC_MODE_TEST must be set to 1
	( Two mode should not be set at the same time)
	- To test capture mode, the symbol CAPTURE_MODE_TEST must be set to 1
