Purpose:
	This is a simple example about PWM function on LPC17xx.
	This program illustrates the PWM signal on 3 Channels in both edge mode
	and single mode.
	Peripheral clock for PWM: PWM_PCLK = CCLK / 4 = 72MHz/4 = 18MHz and there is no
	prescale for PWM. The PWM timer/counter clock is at 18MHz. The base rate is set to 100
	The base PWM frequency is at 18MHz/100 = 180 KHz.
	Each PWM channel will be configured as following:
	- Channel 2: Double Edge
	- Channel 4: Double Edge
	- Channel 5: Single Edge
	The Match register values are as follows:
	- MR0 = 100 (PWM rate)
	- MR1 = 41, MR2 = 78 (PWM2 output)
	- MR3 = 53, MR4 = 27 (PWM4 output)
	- MR5 = 65 (PWM5 output)
	PWM Duty on each PWM channel:
	- Channel 2: Set by match 1, Reset by match 2.
	- Channel 4: Set by match 3, Reset by match 4.
	- Channel 5: Set by match 0, Reset by match 5.
	Using Oscilloscope to observe the PWM signals
	Using UART0 with this configuration – 115200bps – 8 data bit – No parity – 1 stop bit – No flow control 
	to display this conversion.

Hardware configuration:
	This example tested on Keil MCB1700 with LPC1768 ver.1
	These jumpers must be configured as following:
	- VDDIO, VDDREGS, VBUS, LED must be closed.

Running mode:
	This example can run on RAM mode with a debugger or run on FLASH after burning.
