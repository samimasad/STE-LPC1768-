Purpose:
	This is a simple RTC example. Using RTC to generate interrupt in 
	Second Counter Increment Interrupt (1s) and Alarm interrupt at 10s.
	UART0 – 115200bps – 8 data bit – No parity – 1 stop bit – No flow control.

Hardware configuration:
	This example tested on Keil MCB1700 vers.1
	These jumpers must be configured as following:
		- VDDIO, VDDREGS, VBUS, LED, must be closed.

Running mode:
	This example can run on RAM mode with a debugger or run on FLASH.
