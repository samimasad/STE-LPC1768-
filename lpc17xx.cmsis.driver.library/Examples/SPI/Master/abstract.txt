Purpose:
	An example of SPI using interrupt mode to test the SPI driver.
	This example uses SPI in master mode to communicate with SPI slave
	device.
	The master and slave transfer together a number of data byte.
	UART0 – 115200bps – 8 data bit – No parity – 1 stop bit – No flow control.
	
Hardware configuration:
	This example tested on Keil MCB1700 vers.1
	These jumpers must be configured as following:
		- VDDIO, VDDREGS, VBUS, LED, must be closed.
		
	SPI Connectivity:
		- P0.15 - SCK;
	 	- P0.16 - SSEL - used as GPIO
	  	- P0.17 - MISO
	  	- P0.18 - MOSI
		Common ground must be connected together between two board.
		
Running mode:
	This example can run on RAM mode with a debugger or run on FLASH.
	
Note:
	None
