Purpose:
	An example of SSP using interrupt mode to test the SSP driver.
	This example uses SSP in SPI frame as slave mode to communicate with SSP master
	device.
	The master and slave transfer together a number of data byte.
	UART0 – 115200bps – 8 data bit – No parity – 1 stop bit – No flow control.
	
Hardware configuration:
	This example tested on Keil MCB1700 vers.1
	These jumpers must be configured as following:
		- VDDIO, VDDREGS, VBUS, LED, must be closed.
		
	SPI Connectivity:
		- P0.15 - SCK;
	 	- P0.16 - SSEL
	  	- P0.17 - MISO
	  	- P0.18 - MOSI
	Common ground must be connected together between two board.
		
Running mode:
	This example can run on RAM mode with a debugger or run on FLASH.
	
Note:
	None
