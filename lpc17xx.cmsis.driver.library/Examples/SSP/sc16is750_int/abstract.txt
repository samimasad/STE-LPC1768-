Purpose:
	An example of SSP using interrupt mode to test the SSP driver.
	Using SSP in SPI frame mode as master/8bit on LPC1768 to communicate with
	SC16IS750/760 Demo Board
	UART0 – 115200bps – 8 data bit – No parity – 1 stop bit – No flow control.
	
Hardware configuration:
	This example tested on Keil MCB1700 vers.1
	These jumpers must be configured as following:
		- VDDIO, VDDREGS, VBUS, LED, must be closed.
		
	SSP Connectivity:
		- P0.15 - SCK;
	 	- P0.16 - SSEL - used as GPIO
	 	- P0.17 - MISO
	  	- P0.18 - MOSI
	Common ground must be connected together between two board.
		
Running mode:
	This example can run on RAM mode with a debugger or run on FLASH.
	
Note:
	In this case, SSEL pin itself on SSP module should not be selected because
	of difference about /CS pin on SC16IS750 during operation. The /CS pin
	should be pulled low continuously during operation, while SSP operation
	inserts a 'gap' between each data frame transition.
	The SSEL on P0.16 therefore operates as GPIO function.
