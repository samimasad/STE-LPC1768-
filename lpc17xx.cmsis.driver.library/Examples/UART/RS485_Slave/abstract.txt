Purpose:
	- This example used to test RS485 functionality on UART1 of
	LPC1768.
	In this case, RS485 function on UART1 acts as slave mode on
	RS485 bus.
	RS485 Slave device in this example can operate in separate mode
	as following:
	-  Slave device always receives all frames on RS485 bus, regardless
	data frame (9 bit mode with parity stick '0') or slave address
	frame (9 bit mode with parity stick '1').
	- Slave device does not always receive all frames on RS485 bus. In this
	case, only slave address frame can trigger an interrupt event,
	then slave device can accept the following data frame by determine that
	slave address frame is its own address or not(implemented by software).
	- Slave device is in auto slave address detection mode. In this mode,
	only slave address frame with slave address value that matched with
	pre-configured slave address will be accepted automatically (by hardware)
	and trigger an interrupt callback event to handle following data frames.
	UART0 (115.2Kbps - 8N1) is used to display information during
	RS485 operation of slave.

Hardware configuration:
	This example tested on Keil MCB2300 platform v4.0 with LPC1768
	These jumpers must be configured as following:
		- VBUS must be closed.
		- All remaining jumpers must be opened.
		About the RS485 transceiver wiring, see the 'Transceiver_Slave.png' 
		in this directory.

Running mode:
	This example can run on RAM mode with a debugger or run on FLASH.
	
Note:
	The RS485 slave device must initialize first.
