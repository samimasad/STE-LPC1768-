Purpose:
	This is a simple UART example using UART1 will Full modem mode
	UART1 – 9600bps – 8 data bit – No parity – 1 stop bit – Hardware flow control.

Hardware configuration:
	This example tested on Keil MCB1700 vers.1
	These jumpers must be configured as following:
		- VDDIO, VDDREGS, VBUS must be closed.

Running mode:
	This example can run on RAM mode with a debugger or run on FLASH.
	
Note:
	- Because Keil board does not wire all pins of UART1 to the COM1 port,
	the signal on CTS, RTS might be in incorrect state for UART1 running.
	In this case, CTS pin must be pulled-low (P0.17)
