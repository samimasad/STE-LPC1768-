The 'SPI' project is a simple program for the LPC1766 
using Keil 'MCB2300' Evaluation Board and demonstrating 
the use of SPI.
This program uses SPI in master/8bit mode on LPC1766 
to communicate with SC16IS750/760 Demo Board 
or AT25 SPI EEPROM.
 
Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =            	12.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =           	72.00 MHz
   - PCLK    = SYSCLK/4 = 	18.00 MHz

The UART program is available in different targets:
  RAM:         runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                       (used for target debugging)
  FLASH:       runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                       (used for production or target debugging)


-- CMSIS ---------------------------------------------
SpiDev:
  - only master
  - only 8 bit data format

  - open   auto SS or manual SS

SpiDev_LPC17xx:
  - used Baudrate is selected one if possible otherwise 
    next lower possible Baudrate (100KHz is default)

SPI slave device: selected via compiler switch 
(SC16IS750/760 or AT25 EEPROM)
